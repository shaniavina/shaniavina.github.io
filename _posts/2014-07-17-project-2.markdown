description: We present an open-source algorithm, Scalpel (http://scalpel.sourceforge.net/), which combines mapping and assembly for sensitive and specific discovery of insertions and deletions (indels). It is based on the de Bruijn graph assembly paradigm and implements an on-the-fly repeat composition analysis coupled with a self-tuning k-mer strategy to increase specificity in regions characterized by complex repeat structures.
