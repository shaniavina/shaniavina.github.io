description: In this study, we investigate sources of insertions and deletion (indel) errors and provide a guideline to effectively reduce such errors in genome sequencing. We also introduce a novel classification scheme of indels calls based off of Chi-Square scores and alternative allele coverage. You can view my presentation slides at the 2014 Biological Data Science meeting <a href="http://schatzlab.cshl.edu/presentations/2014.11.08.Indel%20Errors.pdf">here</a>.
